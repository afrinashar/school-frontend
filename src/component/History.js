   Article 45 of the Indian Constitution mandated the State to endeavor to
   provide, within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the
   Constitution, free and compulsory education for all children until they
   complete the age of 14 years. By the 86th Amendment Act 2002, Article
   21A of the Constitution was inserted declaring that right to education
   for all children from the age of 6 -14 is the fundamental right.
   Elementary Education refers to the first phase of compulsory education
   that children obtain from the age of 6 to 14 years. It provides students
   the basic understanding of various subjects and develops critical
   thinking skills which they require throughout their lives. In 2009
   Parliament enacted the Right of Children to free and compulsory
   Education Act 2009 (Act 35 of 2009) with the object of free and
   compulsory education to all the children from the age of 6 - 14 years.
